Triva game made with vanilla JavaScript

Players begin with a 60 second timer to answer a multiple choice question. If the player guesses correctly, they gain a point and move to the next question. The timer will then restart. If the player answers the question wrong, then their missed question is tracked as a loss, the game moves to the next question and the timer resets.
